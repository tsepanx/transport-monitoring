# transport-monitoring

Our school project, written in 2018/2019 years.

Uses [YandexTransportWebdriverAPI-Python](https://github.com/OwlSoul/YandexTransportWebdriverAPI-Python) project, to get information about different buses, stops and routes in Moscow.
We have not been able to achieve the desired result, because, suddenly, `YandexTransportWebdriverAPI-Python` was killed by Yandex.
You can read more about it [there](https://github.com/OwlSoul/YandexTransportWebdriverAPI-Python#%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B0)

Current state is **DEAD**, because it depends on a project above, that is also **DEAD**
